<h1>Aim</h1>
<p>Downloading and installing VScode(hello world and calculator program)</p>
<hr>
<h1>Software Used</h1>
<p>VS code</p>
<hr>
<h1>Theory</h1>
<p>To begin C++ programming, we downloaded and installed Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a popular code editor. We then wrote and executed a simple "Hello World" program and a basic calculator program to get familiar with the development environment and C++ syntax.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>By setting up VS Code and running these initial programs, we established a strong foundation for C++ programming. The experience provided insight into basic output, user input, and arithmetic operations, which are key elements in further developing C++ skills..</p>
